# claude-worktime

Track active working time in [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) sessions.

```
my-org/my-project (main ✓) · ⏱  today 2h32m 🤖55m 👤1h37m · total 12h30m
08:22 ▮▮▮···▮▮▮▮··▮▮▮ 17:30 · ▶1h12m ⏸ 20m · ◑30% ↻3h21m →51% · ⑦5% ↻Sat · ctx 77% ⟳93%
```

Two lines, two perspectives on the same data:
- **Line 1** — work done: project time with Claude/You split
- **Line 2** — your day: presence timeline, break rhythm, rate limits

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gunther-Schulz/claude-worktime.git
cd claude-worktime
./install.sh --statusline
```

Or with curl:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gunther-Schulz/claude-worktime/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --statusline
```

Then **restart Claude Code**. That's it — time tracking starts automatically.

Options: `--statusline` enables the status bar, `--force` overwrites existing hooks.

<details>
<summary>What the installer does</summary>

- Copies the script to `~/.local/bin/claude-worktime`
- Creates default config at `~/.config/claude-worktime/config.sh` (preserved on reinstall)
- Adds event hooks to `~/.claude/settings.json` (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, StopFailure)
- Adds a fenced section to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` so Claude knows about the tool (auto-updated on reinstall)
- Verifies dependencies

</details>

## Uninstall

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

Removes hooks, statusline config, the script, and the CLAUDE.md section. Logs and config are preserved.

## What you see

### Statusline

Up to 3 configurable lines. Every element is a token — mix and match what matters to you.

**Line 1 — Work done** (project-scoped):
```
my-org/my-project (main ✓) · ⏱  today 2h32m 🤖55m 👤1h37m · total 12h30m
```
Total productive time, split into Claude's work and yours. Scoped to the current project.

**Line 2 — Your day** (cross-session):
```
08:22 ▮▮▮···▮▮▮▮··▮▮▮ 17:30 · ▶1h12m ⏸ 20m · ◑30% ↻3h21m →51% · ⑦5% ↻Sat · ctx 77% ⟳93%
```

| Element | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `▮▮··▮▮▮` | Day timeline — ▮ = present, · = away |
| `08:22` | Start time (first event today) |
| `17:30` | Current time |
| `▶1h12m` | Presence streak since last break (yellow >1.5h, red >2.5h) |
| `⏸ 20m` | Duration of most recent break |
| `◑30% ↻3h21m →51%` | 5h rate limit: used, time to reset, projected at reset |
| `⑦5% ↻Sat` | 7d rate limit: used, reset day |
| `ctx 77% ⟳93%` | Context window fullness + KV cache hit ratio |

One character per time slot (`TIMELINE_SLOT`, default: 1800 seconds / 30 minutes). Set to `3600` for hourly or `900` for 15-minute resolution.

### CLI queries

```bash
claude-worktime                       # current session
claude-worktime --today               # today's total
claude-worktime --week                # this week
claude-worktime --since 2026-03-25    # since a date
claude-worktime --breakdown --today   # Claude vs You time split
claude-worktime --gaps --today        # gap distribution (tune threshold)
claude-worktime --summary --today     # per-project breakdown
claude-worktime --csv --today         # export as CSV
claude-worktime --cost --today        # cost analysis (needs LOG_COST=true)
claude-worktime --tokens              # statusline token legend
```

All filters (`--today`, `--week`, `--since`, `--filter`, `--branch`, `--session`) combine with any mode. Add `--raw` for JSON output.

### Phase breakdown

`--breakdown` shows how time splits:

```
  Claude:     1h 39min     51%
  You:        1h 32min     48%
  ─────────────────────────
  Active:     3h 13min
  Away:       45min        (1)
  Breaks:     20min        (1)
  Downtime:   12h 15min
```

- **Claude** — attended Claude work time
- **You** — your active time (reading, thinking, typing)
- **Active** — Claude + You (total productive time)
- **Away** — prompt-to-prompt spans exceeding threshold (you weren't at your desk)
- **Breaks** — idle gaps outside away spans (you were in the CLI but inactive)
- **Downtime** — quit and came back outside away spans

### Cost analysis

`--cost` shows API-equivalent cost per project (requires `LOG_COST=true`):

```
Cost by project:
  Hendrik/26-05 Todenbuettel  $3.46

  Total: $3.46
```

This shows what your session would cost at API rates. On subscription plans (Pro/Max), this is informational — not your actual bill. Your real budget is the rate limit windows.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/claude-worktime/config.sh` — plain bash, sourced at startup. All defaults are built into the script; the config only needs settings you want to override.

A commented-out template with all options is created on install.

Empty tokens are automatically removed along with their surrounding separators.

### Groups and layout

Define named groups, then compose lines by listing group names. The divider (`GROUP_DIVIDER`, default ` · `) is inserted between non-empty groups. Empty groups are hidden.

```bash
# Groups
GROUP_PROJECT="{project} ({git})"
GROUP_TODAY="{status} today {today_project}"
GROUP_TOTAL="total {project_total}"
GROUP_TIMELINE="{today_start} {timeline} {today_now}"
GROUP_BREAKS="{since_break} {last_break}"
GROUP_RATE_5H="{rate_5h} ↻{rate_5h_reset} {rate_5h_proj}"
GROUP_RATE_7D="⑦{rate_7d} ↻{rate_7d_day} {rate_7d_proj}"
GROUP_CONTEXT="ctx {context}"

# Lines (space-separated group names)
STATUSLINE_1="PROJECT TODAY TOTAL"
STATUSLINE_2="TIMELINE BREAKS RATE_5H RATE_7D CONTEXT"
GROUP_DIVIDER=" · "
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Add Claude/You split to today
GROUP_TODAY="{status} today {today_project} 🤖{today_claude} 👤{today_you}"

# Add model and cost as a third line
GROUP_MODEL="{model} · {cost}"
STATUSLINE_3="MODEL"

# Compact single line
GROUP_COMPACT="{project} · {status} {session} ({today}) · {rate_5h}"
STATUSLINE_1="COMPACT"
STATUSLINE_2=""
```

**Per-group colors:** `GROUP_<NAME>_COLOR` gives a group its own color, falling back to `COLOR_NORMAL`.

```bash
GROUP_RATE_7D_COLOR="dark-gray"
GROUP_CONTEXT_COLOR="dark-gray"
```

### Colors

```bash
COLOR_NORMAL="green"              # working normally
COLOR_RATE_WARNING="yellow"       # projected rate ≥90%
COLOR_RATE_CRITICAL="red"         # projected rate ≥100%
COLOR_DEFAULT="dark-gray"         # dividers and secondary text
```

Presets: `black`, `red`, `green`, `yellow`, `blue`, `magenta`, `cyan`, `white`, `gray`, `dark-gray`, `light-gray`, `orange`, `pink`, `purple`, `bright-green`, `bright-red`, `bright-yellow`, `bright-blue`, `bright-white`, `dim`, `reset`, `none`. Raw ANSI codes also work.

### Break reminder

`{since_break}` changes color when you've been working too long:

- **Yellow** at `STREAK_WARNING` (default: 1.5 hours)
- **Red** at `STREAK_CRITICAL` (default: 2.5 hours)

A "break" is any period exceeding `PAUSE_THRESHOLD` (default: 15 minutes) since your last prompt — whether you were idle, quit and came back, or Claude was running a long autonomous job. Set thresholds to `0` to disable.

### Auto-rotation

Old log entries are archived on session start. Daily rotation keeps the active log small.

```bash
AUTO_ROTATE=true
ROTATE_INTERVAL=daily    # daily, weekly, monthly
```

Archives: `activity-2026-03-28.jsonl` (daily), `activity-2026-W13.jsonl` (weekly), `activity-2026-03.jsonl` (monthly). Summary records preserve `{project_total}` across rotations.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE_WORKTIME_CONFIG` | `~/.config/claude-worktime` | Config directory |
| `CLAUDE_WORKTIME_DATA` | `~/.local/share/claude-worktime` | Data directory |
| `CLAUDE_WORKTIME_PAUSE` | `900` | Idle threshold in seconds (overrides config) |

Paths follow [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/).

## How it works

### Events

Six hooks log events to a JSONL file:

| Hook | Event | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| SessionStart | `start` | CLI starts or resumes |
| UserPromptSubmit | `prompt` | User sends a message |
| PreToolUse | `tool_start` | Tool about to execute |
| PostToolUse | `tool_end` | Tool finished |
| Stop | `response` | Claude finished responding |
| StopFailure | `response` | API error (still counts as work) |

The log stores raw events only — concepts like "break" and "idle" are derived at query time based on `PAUSE_THRESHOLD`. Change the threshold and all historical data is reinterpreted.

### Time model

Two models, one fork point — same events, same threshold, same log:

**Active time** (line 1 — "was work happening?"):
Gap-by-gap classification. Each gap between consecutive events is either productive or idle. A user turn (`response → prompt`) exceeding the threshold is idle. All Claude turns count as productive regardless of duration.

**Presence** (line 2 — "was the user at their desk?"):
Prompt-to-prompt spans. If the time between two consecutive user prompts exceeds the threshold, the user was away for that entire period — regardless of what happened in between (Claude working, tools running, idle time). This naturally handles long agent jobs and post-response gaps as one continuous absence.

The two models agree in normal conversation and only diverge during long autonomous Claude turns. A 21-minute agent job followed by 10 minutes before the user returns is one 31-minute away span in line 2, while line 1 counts the 21 minutes of Claude work as productive.

**Presence model notes:** The prompt-to-prompt measurement is approximate by seconds to a few minutes — return reading time, short work blips between long breaks, and the exact moment you stepped away are not precisely captured. This is fine for its purpose: the break reminder is a health nudge, not a timesheet. Active time (line 1) is always precise.

### Tracking dimensions

Each entry records **session ID**, **project path**, and **git branch**:

- **Session** (`{session}`, `--session`) — tied to Claude Code's session ID, persists across resume
- **Project** (`{today_project}`, `--filter`) — based on working directory
- **Branch** (`{git}`, `--branch`) — git branch at event time

### Cache hit ratio

`{context}` shows `77% ⟳93%` — context window fullness + KV cache hit ratio from the most recent API response. High (>95%) in steady conversation; drops during tool-heavy work (new content that hasn't been cached), after breaks (server cache expires), or at conversation start. Stateless — always reflects the current state.

## Diagnostics

```bash

```

## Log format

JSONL at `~/.local/share/claude-worktime/activity.jsonl`:

```jsonl
{"t":1774632641,"p":"/path/to/project","b":"main","s":"session-uuid","e":"start"}
{"t":1774632642,"p":"/path/to/project","b":"main","s":"session-uuid","e":"prompt"}
{"t":1774632655,"p":"/path/to/project","b":"main","s":"session-uuid","e":"response"}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `t` | Unix timestamp |
| `p` | Project path |
| `b` | Git branch (omitted if not in a git repo) |
| `s` | Session ID |
| `e` | Event type |

### Files

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.config/claude-worktime/config.sh` | Configuration |
| `~/.local/share/claude-worktime/activity.jsonl` | Active log |
| `~/.local/share/claude-worktime/activity-*.jsonl` | Rotated archives |
| `~/.local/bin/claude-worktime` | The script |

## Dependencies

| Tool | Min version | Required | Used for |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **bash** | 4.0 | yes | `mapfile`, `read -t 0.1`, arrays |
| **jq** | 1.6 | yes | JSONL parsing, aggregation |
| **git** | 2.22 | no | `{git}` status token, branch logging |
| **date** | GNU coreutils or BSD | yes | timestamp conversion |

Run `claude-worktime --check` to verify. No python, no node, no extra runtimes.

## Known limitations

**Hook reliability (~93%).** Claude Code hooks occasionally don't fire — about 7% of events are missed. Total active time is unaffected. The Claude/You split may shift by a few percent. A missed prompt event merges two prompt-to-prompt spans into one, which may create a false away span or extend an existing one.

**Statusline refresh.** Refreshes after each assistant response and tool use, but not while you're typing. Rate limit and context tokens require the first API round-trip before appearing.
